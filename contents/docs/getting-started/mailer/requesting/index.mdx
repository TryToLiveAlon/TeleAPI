## First Request 

To send the first request to our Mailer API, we need an **HTTPS client** that allows us to communicate with the server. In **Python**, we can use the `requests` library, while in **Node.js**, we can use `node-fetch` or `axios`.

However, for API documentation and testing, we will be using [**Hoppscotch**](https://hoppscotch.io), a powerful and developer-friendly API testing tool. Hoppscotch provides a clean and intuitive GUI, making it easier to send, test, and debug API requests. It helps in managing API keys, request history tracking, and the ability to save and organize API calls seamlessly. 

### Steps
